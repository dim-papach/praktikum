For ease of use I have decided to run the code inside of a =vevn= so the =maskfill= package doesn't destroy our PCs (the config files are a piece of art).

--------------

Install =poetry= with =pip=

#+begin_src sh
pip install poetry
#+end_src

Clone my git repo

#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/dim-papach/praktikum.git
#+end_src

cd into the /mask/ directory

#+begin_src sh
cd praktikum/mask
#+end_src

Install and update dependencies and run the code inside of a =vevn=

#+begin_src sh
poetry install #downloads dependencies ONLY inside of the venv from the .toml file
poetry run python main_mask.py
#+end_src

Execute the code

#+begin_src sh
poetry update
poetry install
poetry run python main_mask.py
#+end_src
