For ease of use I have decided to run the code inside of a `vevn` so the `maskfill` package doesn&rsquo;t destroy our PCs (the config files are a piece of art).

---

Install `poetry` with `pip`

    pip install poetry

Clone my git repo

    git clone https://github.com/dim-papach/praktikum.git

cd into the *mask* directory

    cd praktikum/mask

Download dependencies

    poetry install #downloads dependencies ONLY inside of the venv from the .toml file

Run the script

    poetry run python main_mask.py
